Hello! My name is Justin Morris. I am currently completing my BS in Computer Engineering with a Minor in Computer Science.  I am studying computer architecture, digital system design, VLSI, embedded systems, networking, real-time systems, artificial intelligence, and data structures and algorithms. I currently hold an AS degree in Computer Science from Virginia Western Community College. I have an interest in designing and developing computer software and electronics as well as working with AI. I am also currently a TA for the “Fundamental Digital Systems” electrical engineering course at Virginia Tech.
